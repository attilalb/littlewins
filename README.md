# littlewins.

littlewins is an open-source platform where you can share anything you're proud of without being accused of bragging.
Share your successes with the world, see what others had to share, give and receive kudos. :heart:

## About the project

My goal with creating littlewins was to learn by building. This is my first full-stack Next.js app built from scratch.
[JSMastery](https://github.com/adrianhajdin)'s [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wm5gMKuwSYk) was a great help in understanding the concepts and developing littlewins.

## Used Technologies

- Next.js 13 (with App Router)
